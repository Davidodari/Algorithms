## AlgorithmsðŸš§ ðŸš§(In-Progress)ðŸš§ðŸš§

This Repository contains implementation to common or any interesting algorithms with Kotlin and their analysis.

Each module represents a subset of different types/forms of algorithms

To Contribute to this repository e.g  adding a set of algorithms classified under dynamic programming
1. Create the module ```Dynamic Programming``` with ``src`` directory containing the algorithm(s) implementation each with their own class/file and ``test`` directory for tests related to the algorithm.
This follows the default java project structure.
